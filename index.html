<!--About/Information-->
<section class="About">
    <h3 class="about-text">
        Hello everyone! My name is Natalie I am your florist located in Queens, New York. I decided to become a florist at the age of 19 for many reasons that converged to shape my career path. Growing up, I always had a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature and the vibrant colors that bloomed around me. However, during a particularly challenging period in my life, I stumbled upon the therapeutic power of flowers. Their delicate petals and soothing fragrances brought me a sense of peace during difficult times. This newfound connection inspired me to explore the world of floristry. The idea of creating arrangements that could evoke emotions and brighten someone's day resonated with me on a profound level. At 19, I embarked on this floral journey, hoping to not only craft exquisite bouquets but also to bring a bit of joy and serenity to people's lives through the simple yet profound language of flowers. It's a choice I've never regretted, as every day in this colorful world of petals and blossoms is a reminder of the beauty that surrounds us and the positive impact we can make with a handful of blooms. Being a florist allows me to immerse myself in the beauty of nature every single day, creating stunning arrangements that convey emotions and tell unique stories. The joy I find in selecting and arranging flowers is unparalleled, and it's a privilege to share this love with others, brightening their lives with the simple yet profound magic of flowers.
